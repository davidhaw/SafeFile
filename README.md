Developers:
You are welcome to add and suggjest any changes you think will make the program better. Since I am the only one working on the project, I will need ore people to help me add better encryption methods and eventually, and GUI with Java Swing or JavaFx. 

Users:
Since this project isn't even close to being finished or having an full release, I suggjest that you try it out, give some feedback, but use  other programs such as Kleopatra to encrypt, sign, and decrypt your files.
